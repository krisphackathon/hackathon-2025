# 🚀 **Krisp Hackathon 2025**

**September 12 - 14 | Krisp Office | Yerevan**

### **Build. Collaborate. Push the Limits of GenAI.**

Krisp is hosting a 3-day on-site hackathon for Armenia’s top engineers - a unique opportunity to team up, take on cutting-edge technical challenges, and build something that pushes the boundaries of what GenAI can do.

### 🧠 **The Challenge**

In teams of 3-4 participants, you’ll have 48 hours to build an **AI-powered chat application** that can interact with a **proprietary knowledge base** - one that intentionally exceeds traditional context limits and demands creative, production-aware architecture.

We’re not handing out step-by-step tasks. You’ll be given a **structured dataset** and full freedom to design the system your way.

We’re excited to see solutions that explore:

- Techniques like **RAG**, **GraphRAG**, or multi-hop retrieval
- Context and tool orchestration (e.g. **MCP-style logic**)
- **Agentic workflows**, memory, and planning
- Smart integrations with functions or tools
- Systems designed with real-world constraints in mind: **latency, cost, and scale**

---

### 🏆 **What You Can Win**

- 💰 **$5,000 Grand Prize** for the winning team
- 🎙️ **Recognition and feedback** from Krisp’s engineering leaders
- 🌱 **Follow-up opportunities**

---

### 🧪 **Judging Criteria**

Submissions will be evaluated based on:

- **System design**: Architecture clarity, modularity, and future scalability
- **Innovation**: Creative problem framing and thoughtful trade-offs
- **Application of GenAI**: Going beyond basic prompts to build real systems
- **Functionality**: Working output, coherent responses, and system logic
- **Efficiency**: Awareness of latency, compute cost, and optimization
- **Teamwork & Presentation**: Collaboration, clarity, and storytelling

This isn’t about perfect code - it’s about bold ideas and smart engineering under pressure.
