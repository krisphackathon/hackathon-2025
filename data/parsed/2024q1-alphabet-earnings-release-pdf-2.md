**Webcast and Conference Call Information**  
A live audio webcast of our first quarter 2024 earnings release call will be available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2O2f5dlzcE. The call begins today at 1:30 PM (PT) / 4:30 PM (ET). This press release, including the reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures, is also available at http://abc.xyz/investor.  
We also provide announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs, on our investor relations website (http://abc.xyz/investor).  
We also share Google news and product updates on Google’s Keyword blog at https://www.blog.google/, which may be of interest or material to our investors.

**Forward-Looking Statements**  
This press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make with the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of April 25, 2024. Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.

**About Non-GAAP Financial Measures**  
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage change in constant currency revenues, and other cost of sales, operating expenses, and operating margin, excluding the effect of severance and related and office space charges. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  
We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.


---


There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow”, “Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” and “Reconciliation from Certain GAAP Measures to Certain Non-GAAP Measures, Excluding the Effect of Severance and Related and Office Space Charges” included at the end of this release.

We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:

* Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, devices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; fees received for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases and devices.
* Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues primarily from consumption-based fees and subscriptions received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
* Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related services and internet services.

Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and employee severance in the first quarter of 2024, were not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.

<sup>(1)</sup> Includes all gains and losses, unrealized and realized, on equity securities. For Q1 2024, the net effect of the gain on equity securities of $2.2 billion and the $104 million reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments increased the provision for income tax, net income, and diluted EPS by $493 million, $1.9 billion, and $0.15, respectively. Fluctuations in the value of our investments may be affected by market dynamics and other factors and could significantly contribute to the volatility of OI&E in future periods.

## Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow  
(in millions; unaudited):

We provide non-GAAP free cash flow because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

# Reconciliation from GAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-GAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues  
*(in millions, except percentages; unaudited)*

We provide non-GAAP constant currency revenues (“constant currency revenues”) and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (“percentage change in constant currency revenues”), because they facilitate the comparison of current results to historic performance by excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements (“FX Effect”) as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level, as they are not indicative of our core operating results.

Non-GAAP constant currency revenues is defined as revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and is calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates and excluding any hedging effect recognized in the current period. We calculate the percentage change in constant currency revenues by comparing constant currency revenues to the prior year comparable period revenues, excluding any hedging effect recognized in the prior period.

# Reconciliation from Certain GAAP Measures to Certain Non-GAAP Measures, Excluding the Effect of Severance and Related and Office Space Charges  
*(in millions, except for percentages; unaudited)*

We provide the following non-GAAP measures because they provide useful information to management and investors about the effect on expense growth from the severance and related and office space charges taken in the first quarter of 2023, and for comparability, the severance and related charges taken in the first quarter of 2024:

* Non-GAAP other cost of revenues, excluding severance and related and office space charges  
* Non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding severance and related and office space charges  
* Non-GAAP percentage change in other cost of revenues, excluding severance and related and office space charges  
* Non-GAAP percentage change in operating expenses, excluding severance and related and office space charges  
* Non-GAAP operating income, excluding severance and related and office space charges, and  
* Non-GAAP operating margin, excluding severance and related and office space charges  

These non-GAAP measures exclude the effect of severance and related and office space charges recorded during the first quarters of 2023 and 2024. We calculate the percentage change by comparing expenses and operating income to the prior year comparable quarter, each excluding severance and related and office space charges recorded in the respective periods.
