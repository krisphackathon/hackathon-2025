# Note About Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This presentation may contain forward-looking statements regarding our business, operations, and financial performance. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by law. Given these risk and uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

We present both **GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures** in this presentation. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in this presentation and in the most recent earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.

# Reconciliation from GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow

We provide non-GAAP free cash flow for the current quarter and trailing twelve months (“TTM”) because it is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business and acquisitions, and to strengthen our balance sheet.

* Free cash flow: We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
* TTM free cash flow: We define trailing twelve months free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures for the most recent twelve consecutive months.
