# AI Mode is now available in five new languages around

# the world.


Starting today, we’re bringing AI Mode, our most powerful AI search experience, to five new languages for


users around the globe: [Hindi,](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/google-search-ai-mode-now-available-in-hindi/) [Indonesian,](https://blog.google/intl/id-id/products/explore-get-answers/google-search-memperkenalkan-mode-ai-di-indonesia/) [Japanese,](https://blog.google/intl/ja-jp/products/explore-get-answers/ai-mode-search/) [Korean,](https://blog.google/intl/ko-kr/products/explore-get-answers/ai-mode-in-korean) and Brazilian [Portuguese.](https://blog.google/intl/pt-br/produtos/busca-do-google-agora-o-brasil-ja-pode-usar-o-modo-ia-em-portugues)


Building a truly global Search goes far beyond translation ~~—~~ it requires a nuanced understanding of local


information. With the advanced multimodal and reasoning capabilities of our custom version of Gemini 2.5 in


Search, we’ve made huge strides in language understanding, so our most advanced AI search capabilities are


locally relevant and useful in each new language we support.


With this expansion, more people can now use AI Mode to ask complex questions in their preferred language,


while exploring the web more deeply. Try AI Mode at [google.com/ai.](https://www.google.com/gasearch?udm=50&aep=46&source=25q3-US-Keyword-blog-i18nAIM)
